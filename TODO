TODO -- a list of general things I left out so I could get a working system quickly

Primitives
	all kinds of operations
		when I get to this, I should have some sort of code generator
		it can generate all the code to link up the interpreter/compiler with the implementation
Lexer
	string interpolation
		for this, I need to track at least paren depth, probably general enclosement depth
	literate files
	unicodizing
	sanity checking/unit testing
