Anonymous points are not a general method of program composition.
They are for placing slots in a partially-applied function or distfix. For example:
	foo ≡ bar a _ c d
	(if _ = x' then c else a) ∘ foo $ b
Do not let them do fancy stuff like the following. It will get confusing, particularly when you add features.
	_>>=_ ≡ _ ∘ unMonad
